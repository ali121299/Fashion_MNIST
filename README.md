## Dataset Description
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

1-T-shirt/top
2-Trouser
3-Pullover
4-Dress
5-Coat
6-Sandal
7-Shirt
8-Sneaker
9-Bag
10-Ankle boot
# Project Phases
## Data Preparations
In this project, you will use the Fashion-MNIST dataset using a CNN neural network architecture.

-First, download the data file, load it, and
-Describe the data
-Clean the data
-Check the data for missing values or duplicates and carry out proper correction methods
-Visualize the data using proper visualization methods.
-Draw some of the images
-Carry out required correlation analysis
-Carry out any required preprocessing operations on the data
-Encode the labels
## Training a CNN neural network
-We will implement a LeNet-5 network to recognize the Fashion MNIST digits.
-Modify hyperparameters to get to the best performance you can achieve.
-Evaluate the model using 5-fold cross-validation.
-Try to use other two CNN models (using transfer learning) and compare the results with the full trained LeNet-5
